Import the project to a Dynamic Web Project in Eclipse


You would need Apache Tomcat to run this , Apache Tomcat 9 works at this time (5/28/2018)

All required libraries except Hibernate ORM are in WEB-INF/lib


Lastly, I can't find my SQL dump so CRUD functionalities are down until I find them on my ext drv.
